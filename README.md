## Program Overview :
The **BRICS Astronomy** project is an introductory research program in astrophysics, organized by universities from the BRICS network (**Brazil** , **Russia** , **India** , **China** , **South Africa** ), which brings together students and young researchers to explore current key questions in astronomy and observational astrophysics.

### Primary Mission:
The **BRICS Astronomy Program** is designed to **develop and empower young students** passionate about astronomy, data analysis, and machine learning through an intensive 8-week. The program aims to:

- **Build Foundation**: Provide comprehensive training in astronomical data analysis and machine learning applications
- **Skill Development**: Equip participants with practical Python programming and data science skills specifically for astronomy
- **Research Preparation**: Prepare students for independent research projects in astrophysics
- **International Collaboration**: Scientific collaboration among BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa)

### Program Structure & Validation:
- **8-Week Intensive**: Progressive learning from basics to advanced applications
- **Final Project**: Independent research project in the final week to demonstrate acquired skills
- **Certification**: Certificate awarded upon successful completion
- **Performance Assessment**: GPA-based evaluation system

### My Achievement:
- **Final Project Score**: **89/100** GPA
- **Certification Status**: Successfully completed
- **My Project Focus**: Stellar-to-Halo Mass Relation analysis and using machine learning to predict Halo mass

Over eight intensive weeks, participants worked on research projects focused on Introduction to Python to The Machine learning Techniques application in Astronomy:

**Week 1** : Introduction to Python.

**Week 2** : Statistical Analysis.

**Week 3** : Data Visualisation.

**Week 4** : Astronomical Data Source & Handling Fits file.

**Week 5** : Time Series for Astronomical Data.

**Week 6** : Machine Learning Basics for Astronomy.

**Week 7** : Machine Learning.

**Week 8** : Project Preparation.

This program was designed to strengthen technical and scientific skills about Data Analysis and Machine learning techniques.

## My Project Description:

This project explored the relationship between **stellar mass (M*)** and dark matter **halo mass (Mh)** using data from the **SPARC** and **xGASS** catalogs, combining visualization, analytical modeling to know the Star Formation Rate, and machine learning techniques to predict Halo Mass.

## The data comes from two main catalogs that I use for my project :
- SPARC – WISE Stellar Masses: (https://astroweb.cwru.edu/SPARC/)
- SPARC – HI Kinematics :(https://astroweb.cwru.edu/SPARC/)
- xGASS - The extended GALEX Arecibo SDSS Survey : (https://xgass.icrar.org/data.html)

## Outcomes
Upon completion, participants receive a certificate.
