## Program Overview :
The **BRICS Astronomy** project is an introductory research program in astrophysics, organized by universities from the BRICS network (**Brazil** , **Russia** , **India** , **China** , **South Africa** ), which brings together students and young researchers to explore current key questions in astronomy and observational astrophysics.

### Primary Mission:
The **BRICS Astronomy Program** is designed to **develop and empower young students** passionate about astronomy, data analysis, and machine learning through an intensive 8-week curriculum. The program aims to:

- **🌌 Build Foundation**: Provide comprehensive training in astronomical data analysis and machine learning applications
- **🚀 Skill Development**: Equip participants with practical Python programming and data science skills specifically for astronomy
- **🔬 Research Preparation**: Prepare students for independent research projects in astrophysics
- **🌍 International Collaboration**: Foster cross-cultural scientific collaboration among BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa)

### Program Structure & Validation:
- **📅 8-Week Intensive Curriculum**: Progressive learning from basics to advanced applications
- **🎓 Final Project**: Independent research project in the final week to demonstrate acquired skills
- **📜 Certification**: Certificate awarded upon successful completion
- **📊 Performance Assessment**: GPA-based evaluation system

### My Achievement:
- **Final Project Score**: **89/100** GPA
- **Certification Status**: Successfully completed
- **My Project Focus**: Stellar-to-Halo Mass Relation analysis and using machine learning to predict Halo mass

Over eight intensive weeks, participants worked on research projects focused on:

**Week 1** : Introduction to Python.

**Week 2** : Statistical Analysis.

**Week 3** : Data Visualisation.

**Week 4** : Astronomical Data Source & Handling Fits file.

**Week 5** : Time Series for Astronomical Data.

**Week 6** : Machine Learning Basics for Astronomy.

**Week 7** : Machine Learning.

**Week 8** : Project Preparation.

This program was designed to strengthen technical and scientific skills, while promoting intercultural and interuniversity collaboration.

## My Project:

This project explored the relationship between **stellar mass (M*)** and dark matter **halo mass (Mh)** using data from the **SPARC** and **xGASS** catalogs, combining visualization, analytical modeling to know the Star Formation Rate, and machine learning techniques to predict Halo Mass.

## The data comes from two main catalogs :
- SPARC – WISE Stellar Masses: (https://astroweb.cwru.edu/SPARC/)
- SPARC – HI Kinematics :(https://astroweb.cwru.edu/SPARC/)
- xGASS - The extended GALEX Arecibo SDSS Survey : (https://xgass.icrar.org/data.html)

## Outcomes
Upon completion, participants receive a certificate.
