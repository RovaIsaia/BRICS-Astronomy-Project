## Objectifs:

This project explored the relationship between **stellar mass (M*)** and dark matter **halo mass (Mh)** using data from the **SPARC** and **xGASS** catalogs, combining visualization, analytical modeling to know the Star Formation Rate, and machine learning techniques to predict Halo Mass.

## The data comes from two main catalogs :
- SPARC – WISE Stellar Masses: (https://astroweb.cwru.edu/SPARC/)
- SPARC – HI Kinematics :(https://astroweb.cwru.edu/SPARC/)
- xGASS - The extended GALEX Arecibo SDSS Survey : (https://xgass.icrar.org/data.html)
